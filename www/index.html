        These are the rules of a game. Let it be played upon an infinite
        two-dimensional grid of flowers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rule One. A living flower with less than two living neighbors is cut
        off. It dies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rule Two. A living flower with two or three living neighbors is
        connected. It lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rule Three. A living flower with more than three living neighbors is
        starved and overcrowded. It dies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rule Four. A dead flower with exactly three living neighbors is reborn.
        It springs back to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only play permitted in the game is the arrangement of the initial
        flowers.
      </p>

        This game fascinates kings. This game occupies the very emperors of
        thought. Though it has only four rules, and the board is a flat
        featureless grid, in it you will find changeless blocks, stoic as iron,
        and beacons and whirling pulsars, as well as gliders that soar out to
        infinity, and patterns that lay eggs and spawn other patterns, and
        living cells that replicate themselves wholly. In it, you may construct
        a universal computer with the power to simulate, very slowly, any other
        computer imaginable and thus simulate whole realities, including nested
        copies of the flower game itself. And the game is undecidable. No one
        can predict exactly how the game will play out except by playing it.
